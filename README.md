# CIForms

CIForms allows rapid creation of forms, either standard forms with input fields aimed at receiving data from visitors,
or forms with multiple choice questions or even Cloze tests to administer complex surveys & tests.

All forms include automatic validation, are optionally protected by the latest version of Google recaptcha and have
been inspired by this extension (https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page) at Wikiversity and they diverge
from it mainly because the submitted data are either stored in the database or sent to a provided email address,
rather than used to compute a score.

Please check https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CIForms for the official documentation.
